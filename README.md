# Parallelized Locality sensitive hashing for Fast approximate nearest neighbor search

A custom UDP protocol that offers the reliability of TCP but the speed of UDP , thus combining the best of both worlds.
Uses the three way handshake and syn/ack features of TCP connection for security/reliability and the light weight udp packets
for high speed packet transfer.

## 🔑 Key Feature
- Transfers any file (audio/video/image) from one PC to another in a fast and secure manner 
- If connection is broken it picksup just where it left off to finish the transfer
- Sends a connection failed message to ensure user knows if anything unforseen happens

## 🛠 Skills
