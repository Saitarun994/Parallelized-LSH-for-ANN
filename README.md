# Parallelized Locality sensitive hashing for Fast approximate nearest neighbor search
A Parallelized implementation of locality sensitive hashing for super fast query matching using C++ , capable of cross matching a million queries under 2 mins with 95% accuracy

## ðŸ”‘ Key Feature
- Transfers any file (audio/video/image) from one PC to another in a fast and secure manner 
- If connection is broken it picksup just where it left off to finish the transfer
- Sends a connection failed message to ensure user knows if anything unforseen happens

## ðŸ›  Skills
C++ , parallel computing, multi-threading , approximate nearest neighbor search , Fast search algorithm

## ðŸ“– Libraries Used
Standard C++ & Open MP for parallel computing

## ðŸ“ƒ Lessons Learnt

- Parallel computing
- Parallel input tokenizing for fast read
- Locality sensitive hashing for quick search


## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- Could implement cuda for faster parallel computing
